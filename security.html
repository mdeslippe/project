				<h2>Data Breaches</h2>

				<p class="space-before">
					A <strong>data breach</strong> is defined as any security incident in which unauthorized parties gain access
					to sensitive or confidential information, including personal data including Social Security numbers, bank
					account numbers, healthcare data or corporate data including customer data records, intellectual property, and
					financial information (IBM, 2023). Individuals often have little to no say in how their data is kept secure.
					They are forced to rely on organizations to handle this aspect, even though they're the ones who suffer the
					most from data breaches (Deslippe, 2024). While you may not have direct control over how companies manage your
					data, you can reduce the data you share with them. By providing only essential personal information to
					organizations, any potential data breach would result in minimal information being stolen.

				<h2>Phishing</h2>
				<img src="img/phishing.webp" alt="" />
				<p class="space-before">
					The term <strong>phishing attack</strong> refers to an attempt to steal sensitive information, typically in
					the form of usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other important data in
					order to utilize or sell the stolen information. By masquerading as a reputable source with an enticing
					request, an attacker lures in the victim in order to trick them, similarly to how a fisherman uses bait to
					catch a fish (Cloudflare). Phishing attacks are often carried out through deceptive emails, fraudulent
					websites, or other forms of communication that are designed to appear legitimate. To protect yourself from
					phishing attacks, always stop and double check the legitimacy of the request for information. This can be as
					simple as checking to make sure the website url, or email address is correct. Check for simple spelling
					mistakes or grammar errors that reputable sources would not make.

				<h2>Computer Viruses</h2>
				<img src="img/virus.webp" alt="" />
				<p class="space-before">
					A <strong>computer virus</strong> is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer
					operates and that is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or
					attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the
					process a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software
					by corrupting or destroying data (Norton Canada, 2018). The are a large variety virus types, some of the most
					common include: file-infecting viruses, macro viruses, web browser Viruses, and boot sector viruses (Shield
					Services, 2023). To keep yourself safe from computer viruses, you can apply the following security measures:
					enable anti-virus software, update your software to the latest version, use multi-factor authentication, use
					an ad-blocker when navigating the web, be aware of the signs of phishing, and always think before you click
					(Government of Canada, 2023).
