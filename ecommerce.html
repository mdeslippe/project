							The first phase of e-commerce is known as <strong>E-Commerce 1.0</strong>. It ocurred in the late 1990s
							and the early 2000s. During the first phase, organizations were primarily concerned with establishing a
							presense online. Online shopping was nowhere near as popular as it is now, most people preferred to shop
							in-person. There are many factors that contributed to this, including slow internet, unfamiliarity, lack
							of trust, and primitive websites.
						</p>
					</li>

						<p>
							The second phase of e-commerce is known as <strong>E-Commerce 2.0</strong>. It began in the mid-to-late
							2000s and is still evolving to this day. The second phase saw signifigant increase in the adoption of
							online shopping. There are many factors that contribute to this increase, including: high-speed internet
							becoming easier to access, younger generations feeling more familiar with technology, increased security,
							and feature rich and seamless technology being invented. Another major contributor is social media. People
							see others shopping online and become more acquanted with it.
